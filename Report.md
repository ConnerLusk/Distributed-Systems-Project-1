The algorithm takes in the name of the container and first uses this to compute a list of the hosts exluding the current host. Then two threads are spun, the first being to recieve messages and other to send the messages. The thread that is listening, opens a socket and once it recieves a message, it checks the list of hosts and if the hostname is within this, it adds it to a set of hostnames. Once the sets length is equal to the length of the hostnames(excluding the current host), the program prints it is reading, closes the socket and returns. The other thread iterates over the list of the hostnames three times and before each iteration sleeps three times. This is to compensate for any lag between container start up times. Once all of the iterations are complete this thread exits.
